<h1> Lines of Action </h1>

<p> 
  Lines of Action (LOA) is a board game invented by Claude Soucie.
</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>The objective of this game is to unite all your pieces in to one contiguous set.
You may move only as many pieces (including those of your opponent) as are in your <i>Line Of Action</i>.
  This is the line along the board in the direction which you wish to move. You may not move over your own pieces or those of your opponent. However, you may
capture an opponents piece if it is on the piece you are traveling to. </p>
<h2>Controlling Play</h2>
<p>To control your pieces, click on the piece you would like to move, and then drag to the square you would like to move to. The game will not accept invalid inputs,
  and will instead wait for a valid move. You may click on Game to view various options, including Quitting the game and restarting a new game.
  You may use the 'Options' tab to undo your most recent move (this will also undo the move the AI did immediately after that.) You may also switcht the player
types midway through the game, i.e. switch white to a manual player, or switch black to an AI. However, note that if you switch both to an AI, you will not be able to
switch them back to manual players until the game is over.</p>
